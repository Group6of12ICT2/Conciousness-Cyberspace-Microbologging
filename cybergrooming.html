				<h6>Cyber Grooming</h6>
			
					<a><strong> Cyber grooming is the act of developing a trustworthy relationship with a minor online in order to commit a sexual misconduct. "Common interests" can help malefactors get the attention of teens: discussing fashion, art, sports, music, and entertainment. or use bullying and trolling (provocations, harassment, psychological manipulation) to act aggressively.</strong></a>

                <h5>
How do you avoid cyber grooming?</h5>
                <ul>
                	
                    <p><li>Website management and blocking. Blocking and managing websites is another way to prevent cyberbullying and online predators. You can control which websites children can visit. Limiting your child's freedom and preventing them from accessing harmful websites can go a long way toward protecting them. You can blacklist websites that you do not want your children to visit because many browsers come equipped with built-in security.</li>

                    <li> Monitoring a child's online activity is one of the best things a parent can do to protect them. You don't have to constantly keep an eye on your child because of this. Ask them periodically to demonstrate what they are doing and with whom they are talking to. It's always a good idea to talk openly with your kids about the danger posed by strangers online. You will need to believe what they say when you investigate the situation because trust is a two-way street.</li>
                    	<li> Libel: Libel is the spreading of defamation through written statements. Libel, for instance, refers to the publication of a defamatory article about you.</li></p></ul>

                    
               
               <h5>How would you determine if you're a victim of Cyber Grooming?</h5>
               <p>  Grooming can be done in person or online. It is typically carried out by a member of the victim's family or another member of the victim's circle of trust, such as a coach, teacher, youth group leader, or other individuals who naturally interact with the victim. Grooming can take many different forms, but most of the time, they all follow the same pattern.</p>
               <ul><li>Selecting a victim: Abusers frequently observe potential victims and select them based on their perceived vulnerability or ease of access.</li>
            
                <li>Gaining access to the victim and isolating them: Abusers frequently seek positions in which they have contact with minors and will attempt to physically or emotionally separate a victim from those who are protecting them.</li>
                <li>Building trust and keeping secrets: Gifts, attention, sharing "secrets," and other methods are used by abusers to gain a potential victim's trust and train them to keep the relationship a secret.</li>
                   <li>Desensitization to contact and conversation of sexual themes: When an abuser first begins to touch a victim in ways that appear to be harmless, like hugging, wrestling, and tickling, they frequently progress to more and more sexual contact, like getting a massage or taking a shower together. In order to introduce the idea of sexual contact, abusers may also show the victim pornography or discuss sexual topics with them.</li>
                      <li>Endeavor by victimizers to cause their way of behaving to appear to be normal, to try not to raise doubts. It can be particularly challenging for adolescents, who may be younger than the abuser, to recognize grooming techniques. Be on the lookout for any indications that your teen is involved in a relationship with an adult that involves secrecy, excessive control, or pushing personal boundaries.</li>
