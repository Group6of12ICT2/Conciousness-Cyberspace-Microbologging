                <h5><strong>How to avoid Credit Card Fraud</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <p><li>Keep your credit cards safe. Store your cards in a secure wallet or purse. After making a purchase, immediately return your card to that place.</li>
                         <li>Don't allow websites to "remember" your card number. Only let secure payment portals, like GooglePay and PayPal, remember your card number. An even better practice is to never check the "remember card number" box for any site or portal.</li>
                           <li> Be wary when shopping online. Before using your credit card online, verify the site's security and that the URL is authenticating there's an "s" after the "http" in the web address, and a lock icon as well.</li>
                            <li> Report lost or stolen cards immediately.The sooner you report a missing card, the less liability you'll have for fraudulent charges made with your card.</li>
                            <li>  Review your monthly bill. Always look through your monthly statement to check for suspicious account activity.</li>
                           </p>
                    </ul>
                                   

                 <h5>How to determine if you are experiencing Credit Card Fraud?</h5>
                 <ul>
                    <p><li> It's possible to detect credit card fraud early by routinely checking for signs of shady activity on your credit accounts:
<li>Review your card statements monthly, whether you get them online or in hard-copy form, looking carefully for unexpected purchases or cash advances. If you see any unfamiliar purchases, contact the card issuer immediately to dispute the charges. If you see any credit report entries that look fishy, use the contact information in the credit report to notify the creditor in question. They can give you more information, begin an investigation and may ultimately notify the credit bureaus to remove the account. You can also file a credit report dispute if you believe there are inaccurate entries on your credit reports.</li> </ul>
