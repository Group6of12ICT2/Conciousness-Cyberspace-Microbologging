				<h6>Scamming</h6>
			
					<a><strong>Internet fraud is a sort of cybercrime that involves deception and the use of the Internet. It may entail the concealment of facts or the provision of false information in order to defraud people of their hard-earned cash, assets, and inheritance. Internet fraud is a term used to describe a variety of illegal and illicit activities carried out in cyberspace rather than a single, distinct crime. However, it differs from stealing in that the victim knowingly and deliberately gives the offender the information, money, or property in this instance. It also differs from other crimes in that it involves offenders who are separated in time and space. </strong></a>

                <h5><strong>How to avoid getting Scammed?</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <p><li>Be alert to the fact that scams exist. When dealing with uninvited contacts from people or businesses, whether it's over the phone, by mail, email, in person or on a social networking site, always consider the possibility that the approach may be a scam. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
                     <li>Know who you're dealing with. If you've only ever met someone online or are unsure of the legitimacy of a business, take some time to do a bit more research. Do a Google image search on photos or search the internet for others who may have had dealings with them. If a message or email comes from a friend and it seems unusual or out of character for them, contact your friend directly to check that it was really them that sent it.</li>
                      <li>Do not open suspicious texts, pop-up windows or click on links or attachments in emails – delete them: If unsure, verify the identity of the contact through an independent source such as a phone book or online search. Don't use the contact details provided in the message sent to you.<l>
                      	<li> Keep your personal details secure. Put a lock on your mailbox and shred your bills and other important documents before throwing them out. Keep your passwords and pin numbers in a safe place. Be very careful about how much personal information you share on social media sites. Scammers can use your information and pictures to create a fake identity or to target you with a scam.</li>
                      	 <li> Keep your mobile devices and computers secure. Always use password protection, don’t share access with others (including remotely), update security software and back up content. Protect your WiFi network with a password and avoid using public computers or WiFi hotspots to access online banking or provide personal information.</li>
                      	  <li>  Choose your passwords carefully. Choose passwords that would be difficult for others to guess and update them regularly. A strong password should include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols. Don’t use the same password for every account/profile, and don’t share your passwords with anyone.</li>
                      	   <li> Review your privacy and security settings on social media. If you use social networking sites, such as Facebook, be careful who you connect with and learn how to use your privacy and security settings to ensure you stay safe.  If you recognise suspicious behaviour, clicked on spam or have been scammed online, take steps to secure your account and be sure to report it.</li>
                      	    <li>Beware of any requests for your details or money. Never send money or give credit card details, online account details or copies of personal documents to anyone you don’t know or trust. Don't agree to transfer money or goods for someone else: money laundering is a criminal offence.</li>
                      	      <li> Be wary of unusual payment requests. Scammers will often ask you to use an unusual payment method, including preloaded debit cards, gift cards, iTunes cards or virtual currency such as Bitcoin.</li>
                      	       <li>Be careful when shopping online. Beware of offers that seem too good to be true, and always use an online shopping service that you know and trust. Think twice before using virtual currencies (like Bitcoin) - they do not have the same protections as other transaction methods, which means you can’t get your money back once you send it. Learn more about online shopping scams.</li>

                <ul><li><p>If you have been scammed, make sure you report it to your local police station or you may call the hotline that is assigned to your country in case of incidents like this . You may not always be able to get your money back, but you might be able to take steps to stop it happening again – to you or other people.
